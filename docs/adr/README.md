# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains architecture decision records for the Family Medical App.

## What is an ADR?

ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences. They create a historical record of why we made certain choices.

2. Follow the template to fill in all sections
3. Add a link to your ADR in the relevant section below
